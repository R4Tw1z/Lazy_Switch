## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability in public forums or social media
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Progress Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

## Security Considerations

### Network Security

**Default Credentials**
- The default WiFi password is `12345678`
- **⚠️ CHANGE THIS** for production deployments
- Use a strong, unique password (minimum 8 characters)

**Access Point Mode**
- Device creates an open access point by default
- Consider implementing WPA2 security for production use
- Limited to 4 concurrent connections for stability

**Network Isolation**
- The ESP8266 AP operates on a separate network (192.168.4.0/24)
- No internet access through the device
- Consider firewall rules if integrating with existing networks

### Web Interface Security

**Authentication**
- Currently no authentication is implemented
- Anyone connected to the WiFi can control the device
- Consider adding basic HTTP authentication for sensitive deployments

**Input Validation**
- Servo position values are validated (0-180 degrees)
- No user-provided content is stored permanently
- XSS protection through controlled HTML output

**HTTPS**
- Currently uses HTTP only
- HTTPS is possible but requires additional certificate management
- Consider for sensitive environments

### Physical Security

**Device Access**
- Physical access to the ESP8266 allows full control
- Secure mounting recommended for production deployments
- USB port provides direct programming access

**Servo Control**
- Direct physical manipulation possible
- No feedback mechanism to detect unauthorized movement
- Consider adding position sensors for security applications

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Change Default Password**: Use a strong, unique WiFi password
2. **Network Segregation**: Consider isolating IoT devices on separate network
3. **Physical Security**: Secure device mounting and access
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep firmware updated to latest version
5. **Monitor Access**: Be aware of who has network access

## Security Features

### Current Protections

- ✅ Input validation for servo positions
- ✅ Rate limiting through connection limits
- ✅ Automatic AP restart on failure
- ✅ Watchdog timer for stability
- ✅ Memory management to prevent overflows

### Planned Security Enhancements

- 🔄 HTTP Basic Authentication
- 🔄 WPA2 encryption by default
- 🔄 Rate limiting for web requests
- 🔄 Session management
- 🔄 HTTPS support option
- 🔄 Access logging
